Models
- encapsulate *entities* (a single entity for simple and multiple entities for composite data structures)
- contains *table name(s)* to maps entities to database tables (what about NoSQL?)
- contains data validation schemes and related logic
- contains change tracking mechanism (for atomic updates)
- define access scenarios and permission models (?)
